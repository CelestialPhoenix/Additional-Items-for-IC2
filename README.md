# Additional Items for IC2
A set of ContentTweaker scripts to add a few extra blocks/items, using texture assets modified from stock IC2 textures. 
This project was made to satisfy the permissions requirements for the Blood, Sweat and Gears Modpack. 

This project contains all the IC2 based texture assets which were created during development of Blood, Sweat and Gears.

Textures belong to IC2, and are covered under IC2's licence. 
Scripts were created by PhoePhoe, and are open for anyone to use in whole or in part.
